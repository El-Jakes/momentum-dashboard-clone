CONCEPTS LEARNED

- A random image image is fetched from the Unsplash API using a query string pointing to nature images.
    API link: https://apis.scrimba.com/unsplash/photos/random?orientation=landscape&query=nature

- The html body background was styled in order for the image to automatically fit the window. It pdroduce background image that works on any screen size no matter how it is resized.
the code can be gotten from the link below:
https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/#awesome-easy-progressive-css3-way

- The random image pulled was set as the background-image for the body.
- Image author was also grabbed and rendered on the screen
- Flexbox was used to layout the app

- PROMISE: a ppromise that an operation that normally takes abit of time will eventually finish running

*States a Promis can Be in
-Pending:
-Resolved(fullfilled): the task we wanted to perform finished successfully 
-Rejected: Opposite ofresolved

note: the .then() method is used to tell the code to do something after a promise is Resolved

*HANDLING REJECTED PROMISE
A promise can get rejected if an error is thrown inside any of the the .then() blocks or if a programmer manually calls the Promise.reject() method
-the .catch() method is used for handling rejected promises by chaining it to the .then() block

    fetch("https://apis.com/error")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.log('something went wrong')
        this is where you tell the catch block what to do or how to handle the error as seen below:

        document.body.style.backgroundImage = `url(https://cdn.xxl.thumbs.canstockphoto.com/danger-sign-drawing_csp0665020.jpg)`;

    })

    the .catch() helps with user experience.
- developers sometimes write code that report the error to some kind of services in order to revisit it and debug the error

- 

#COINGECKO API (https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3#/)
 - This API helps in returning current data for a coin and has pother interesting stuffs you might want to checkout.

 *Checking for error response
 -the 'ok' property is used for this
 'response.ok' is used for checking status of a request and in turn checks for error
    example: fetch("https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/dogecoin")
    .then(res => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw Error("Something went wrong")
        }
        console.log(res.status)
        return res.json()
    })
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
    })
    .catch(err => console.error(err))

 Side note: https://httpstat.us/200 is a url that allows us to get certain status back just by default.
    fetch('https://httpstat.us/200')
        .then(res => {
            console.log(res.ok) // true
            console.log(res.status) // true
        })
        .then(data => console.log(data))
        .catch(err => console.error(err))

        404 and above status codes will return false

- Current Time Formating in Javascript (toLocalTimeString())
- create new date
    const date = new Date()
-apply the toLocaleTimeString with the necessary property:value pair.
   const currentTime date.toLocaleTimeString('en-us', {timeStyle: 'short'})
   console.log(currentTime)

- setInterval is used to update time every second like some
    setInterval(() => {
        the time logic goes here
    }, 1000)
